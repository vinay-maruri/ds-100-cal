In part 1 (2A), I created an SQL database containing information about all rides taken in NYC taxicabs from 2016 and 2017. I also did
exploratory data analysis to better understand trends in the data.

In part 2 (2B), I built a linear model to predict ride duration (time) after doing extensive feature engineering to select the best
features for the model.
