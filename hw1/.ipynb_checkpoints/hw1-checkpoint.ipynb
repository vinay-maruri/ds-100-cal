The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health and we have made these data available to you via the DS 100 repository. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through the various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this.

    "What we see when we opened the file above is good news! It looks like this file is indeed a csv file. Let's check the other three files. This time, rather than opening up the files manually, let's use Python to print out the first 5 lines of each. The `ds100_utils` library has a method called `head` that will allow you to retrieve the first N lines of a file as a list. For example `ds100_utils.head('data/legend.csv', 5)` will return the first 5 lines of \"data/legend.csv\". Try using this function to print out the first 5 lines of all four files that we just extracted from the zipfile."

Second, the businesses are located in office buildings. This means that they don't have any physical store space on a streetfront where people can enter the businesses on street level, and these businesses are only accessible by people who work in the office buildings themselves. Third, some businesses don't have a fixed address. These are entries with addresses like \"Off the Grid\" or \"Private Locations\". Since they don't have a fixed address, it is impossible for these businesses to have a postal code. There is also a 4th possibility that there are errors in the data, i.e. that these businesses do have storefronts, they are not in well-known places or tourist areas, and they have fixed addresses. Since I cannot google all of the business names and addresses, I will only state that there is a possibility for data-entry error for postal codes by humans, or by machines if these data were auto-filled in. \n",

    "In question 4a, we counted the number of null values per zip code. Let's now count the proportion of null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new dataframe of counts of the null and proportion of null values, storing the result in `fraction_missing_df`. It should have an index called `postal_code_5` and should also have 3 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `null count`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",
    "2. `not null count`: The number of present values for the zip code.\n",
    "3. `fraction null`: The fraction of values that are null for the zip code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data frame should be sorted by the fraction null in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended approach: Build three series with the appropriate names and data and then combine them into a dataframe. This will require some new syntax you may not have seen. You already have code from question 4a that computes the `null count` series.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pursue this recommended approach, you might find these two functions useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rename`: Renames the values of a series.\n",
    "* `pd.concat`: Can be used to combine a list of Series into a dataframe. Example: `pd.concat([s1, s2, s3], axis=1)` will combine series 1, 2, and 3 into a dataframe.\n",

    "*Hint: You can use the divison operator to compute the ratio of two series.*\n",

The second observation I notice is that the lowest score that was given in this dataset was 48, meaning that if scores are technically on a 0-100 scale and given that there are a lot of high scores given, I believe that inspectors are giving more higher scores than lower scores, and that they are not using the full 0-100 scale, potentially implying that inspection scores are not as rigorous as they should be. The mode of this distribution is 100, which is a perfect score. This is very unusual, as perfect scores elsewhere are not given out nearly as often, nor are they the most common score given out. This may imply again that inspection scoring is not as rigorous as it should be, and that restaurants are not being checked as often as they should. There is long tail from 65 to 80, and there are gaps in the distribution at 95, 97, and 99, all scores which were not present in the dataset. This is very peculiar again, as at very high inspection scores in the \"A+\" range from 95 to 100, only even numbers were given, which is an outcome that is highly unlikely to occur by chance.
